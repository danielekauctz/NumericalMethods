Numerical evaluation of dynamic response: time-stepping methods for integration of differential equations 

The response during each step is calculated from the initial conditions (displacement and velocity) existing at the beginning of the step and from the history of loading during the step. The codes include: constant acceleration method, central difference method, and Newmark's method.
