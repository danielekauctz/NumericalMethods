# Numerical Methods 

Numerical evaluation of dynamic response by time-stepping methods for integration of differential equations. The response during each step is calculated from the initial conditions (displacement and velocity) existing at the beginning of the step and from the history of loading during the step. The Matlab codes include the constant acceleration method, the central difference method, and Newmark's method.
